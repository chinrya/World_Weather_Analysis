# PURPOSE

The purpose of these 3 deliveries was to get us familiar and comfortable with setting up and implementing APIs, as well as becoming accustomed to these specific google map APIs. These activities also allowed for practice with many older skills we have developed over the last many weeks, such as making dataframes, using loc to find specific columns, and using dropna to get rid of any null rows, creating a cleaner dataset.
